In the process of making countries developed, the environment is often neglected. Various inventions made to help as well as provide comfort to mankind such as automobiles, air conditioners, etc led to the deterioration of the environment and the air quality. The major air pollutants are CO (Carbon Monoxide), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), particulate materials (PM2.5, SPM, and RSPM), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), greenhouse gases, and Ozone(O3). These gases cause various respiratory diseases (such as asthma, and pulmonary cancer), Leukemia, Mesothelioma(a type of lung cancer), and premature deaths. In this paper, we will examine the air quality indices of previous years and determine the air quality indices (AQI) of future years in different cities of India, analyze the rate of increase of respiratory diseases caused due to air pollution, deaths due to respiratory diseases and the detection methodologies of diseases like asthma. In order to predict the air quality index of future years on the prepared data set, K-means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is used to find unknown patterns in unlabeled data.
